## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a `technical-analysis-library` integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### The Core Concept: A Bridge Between Analysis and Action

A `technical-analysis-library` (e.g., `TA-Lib`, `Pandas-TA`, or custom-built libraries) is the **brain** of an automated trading system. It calculates indicators like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and moving averages. However, by itself, it cannot trade.

The integration works by building a "bridge" between this analytical brain and the exchange's execution capabilities. This bridge is typically a custom-built application, often referred to as a **trading bot**.

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of how this integration functions:

---

### 1. Data Acquisition: Feeding the Brain

The first step is to get real-time and historical market data from the exchange.

*   **How it's done:** The application uses the exchange's **Public API**.
*   **Mechanism:** The bot makes HTTP requests (usually `GET` requests) to specific API endpoints provided by the exchange.
    *   **Example Endpoints:**
        *   `GET /api/v
